# Problem Statement

Tier 2 and tier 3 college students encounter significant hurdles when seeking
placements and internships, often due to a lack of resources and opportunities.
Despite their potential, these students struggle to effectively connect with
employers, hindering their entry into the job market and perpetuating
inequalities. This open innovation challenge is designed to inspire the
development of solutions that empower students by enhancing their access to
placements and internships.
The primary objective is to mitigate existing disparities by providing a platform
that facilitates seamless connections between these students and potential
employers. Additionally, the challenge seeks to address recruiters'
perspectives, ensuring that the platform offers valuable tools and insights to
attract top talent from these colleges.


Participants could propose comprehensive functionalities addressing the
specific needs of tier 2 and tier 3 college students. Solutions could prioritize
the creation of user-friendly interfaces, efficient matchmaking algorithms,
personalized career guidance, and networking capabilities. Additionally, they
could focus on features for recruiters, like streamlined job posting
management, insights into talent pools, and mechanisms for showcasing
company culture and values to attract top talent. Prioritizing skill development,
seamless application processes, and ensuring data security could be essential
considerations for both parties.
